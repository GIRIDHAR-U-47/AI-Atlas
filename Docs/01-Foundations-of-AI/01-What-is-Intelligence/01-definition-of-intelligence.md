# Definition of Intelligence

## Overview

Intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge, understand concepts, reason about information, and apply it to solve problems and adapt to new situations.

## Key Concepts

### What Makes Something Intelligent?

Intelligence encompasses several capabilities:
- **Learning**: The ability to acquire new knowledge from experience
- **Reasoning**: The capacity to draw conclusions from available information
- **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions to complex challenges
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting behavior based on changing circumstances
- **Understanding**: Comprehending relationships and patterns

### Intelligence in AI Context

In artificial intelligence, we focus on creating systems that can:
1. Perceive their environment
2. Process information
3. Make decisions
4. Take actions to achieve goals

## Formal Definition

> Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.

This definition emphasizes that intelligence isn't just about knowledge storage, but about using that knowledge effectively to accomplish objectives.

## Types of Intelligence

- **Analytical Intelligence**: Problem-solving and logical reasoning
- **Creative Intelligence**: Generating novel solutions
- **Practical Intelligence**: Applying knowledge to real-world situations
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Understanding and managing emotions (less common in AI)

## Measuring Intelligence

Intelligence can be measured through:
- Performance on specific tasks
- Ability to generalize to new situations
- Speed and efficiency of learning
- Complexity of problems that can be solved
